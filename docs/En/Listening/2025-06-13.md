Every late autumn, groups of [black-headed gulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-headed_gull) arrive **"as scheduled"** in [Luzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzhou) City on **the upper reaches of** the [Yangtze River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze). Circling over the water, the red-billed oceanic birds always attract a crowd of bird watchers. The black-headed gull, a rare bird species, is regarded as the **"barometer"** (晴雨表) of the **ecological** status of the environment. The spotting of more such birds reflects **the promising results** produced by Sichuan's green efforts in recent years.

Known as a province of many rivers, Sichuan is an important **water conservation area** and a core area for **ecological construction** along the Yangtze River.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/LuzhouTuoRiver.JPG/1920px-LuzhouTuoRiver.JPG)

Among Sichuan's many water systems, the [Tuojiang River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuo_River) shares a key position. The 25,500 square kilometers it flows through cover the most concentrated, **densely populated**, and **economically powerful areas** in the province. Since the 1990s, the continuous acceleration of **industrialization** and **urbanization** exerted huge environmental burdens on the Tuojiang River, making it once the most severely polluted river in Sichuan.

A campaign to **treat water pollution** was consequently launched in 2018. After years of efforts, the water quality of the Tuojiang River flowing into the mouth (河口) of the Yangtze River has now reached its best level in 20 years.

The ecological improvement also enables local residents to experience the beauty of life.

Chengdu, the **provincial capital**, has embraced more blue skies in recent years thanks to the promotion of air pollution prevention and control work.

### 1.3

As a professor of **Public Policy and Management** at Tsinghua University, I have been working, living, and traveling in China for several years, where I have personally experienced and witnessed the happy life of Chinese people. Their happiness **springs from (comes from)** China's rapid transformation, which can be seen in the details.

The greatest thing about living in China is the convenience. **Shared bikes**, **high-speed trains** and airplanes can take me anywhere at any time.

The highly developed e-commerce network helps me to buy and receive whatever I need quickly. Whether I want to drink tea from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, eat snacks from Shanxi Province, or buy handicrafts from Sichuan Province, all I need to do is tap on my phone and it will be delivered to my home in one to two days.

“Fast” is the **buzzword (流行语)** of **contemporary China**. The fast-paced development reflects a society-wide desire for progress, development, and a **maturing consumer market**. In China, there is a link between the pursuit of “speed” and the improvement of people’s lives.

Happiness in China is not only in the **prosperous cities**, but also in the vast rural areas. As China steps up its **rural revitalization strategy**, it strengthens rural infrastructure and public services, while building livable and beautiful villages. Farmers who used to suffer from poverty and diseases find themselves on the road to happiness.

## 2. Long Conversation

### 2.1

M:Good evening, everyone. This is David at University Radio and with me in the studio is Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Brown, thank you for joining us. Tonight we have a special program dedicated to paternal leave.

W:Good evening. Thank you for having me.

M:So Mrs. Brown, would you please share something with us about paternal leave in Sweden?

W:Of course. Paternal leave gives the father a chance to take time off work to care for his baby and do shopping for the family.

M:How long can fathers stay off from work and do they still get paid?

W:Actually, Sweden has long had generous parental leave. A couple can take up to 13 months off work between them with the employer paying 80% of lost wages up to 3,425 dollars a month. A further 90 days can be taken for a nominal (象征性的) sum. The leave can be used all at once or in batches (分批) before the child is 8. It is notionally divided 50/50. It can be transferred between the parents.

M:Are fathers willing to take paternal leave?

W:Many are reluctant to use their paternal leave. Mothers take as much as 85% of all the parental leave. This frustrates feminists (女权主义者) who believe that shared responsibility for childcare is a key to equality in the labor market. Sweden has one of the world’s highest rates of female participation in the labor force, but women’s wages still lag behind men’s.

M:How does the government look at this?

W:The government sympathizes. It is impressed by evidence that fathers who take more responsibility for small children are more likely to stay in contact. A committee is looking into ways to increase father’s take-up of parental leave.

M:You like living in the city, don’t you?

W:Oh, I love it. It’s so convenient. I can take the bus to work, or the subway, or the taxi. And there is so much to do.

M:I know what you mean. I’d like to live in the city, but living in the suburbs is better for children.

W:Well, there are a lot of good things about suburban living. But, as a working woman, I think a city has all the conveniences—including the best food and fastest news.

M:But there are more trees, grass and fresh air in the suburbs.

W:Yeah, but living in a city, it’s convenient to go everywhere. There are lots of movie houses, theaters and so on. You can take them to the suburbs on the weekends.

M:Yeah, my children are the right age to be here. There are lots of things for them here.

W:You are right. They go to the library in Brooklyn. And then they come back home for lunch, then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History. There is so much for young people to see and do.

M:Not just for young people. What about me? I’ve never been to the Museum of Natural History.

W:Neither have I. When I was a child, I used to go to the Museum of Art.

M:I’ve been there several times. Twice with my children.

W:Well, I have an idea. Next weekend, how about we go to the Museum of Natural History?

M:OK, that’s really a very nice idea.

## 3. Passage

### 3.1

Among many other Chinese traditions, taking family portraits still appears to be common—despite the smartphone boom.

Wei Lin, a local TV host, said the tradition helps strengthen her family’s bond. Wei Lin recalled two of her fondest memories of having her portraits taken. One of the portraits was taken after she turned 18, marking the coming of age in China, and the other one was after she graduated from university. “Graduation means a new starting point, a time to repay my parents for having worked so hard to bring me up,” she said. Her father also links this to the country’s increasingly high living standard, which has, in turn, strengthened the concept of family.

Yang—together with his family of eight—has been taking family portraits for five years to celebrate his first-born daughter’s birthday. “I hope this small act of taking portraits will give my children a sense of perseverance in whatever they do. Not just in celebrating little wins in life, but also, think about it—if you do this every year over ten years, imagine what it will become,” he said. Yang’s mother echoed his sentiments, insisting that taking portraits may look like a simple act, but it is a Chinese tradition—a gesture of respecting the elderly and loving one’s child.

### 3.2

Honey is not only a kind of natural sweetener, it is also delicious. Most people, and many animals, like eating it. However, for some, in Africa, the only way to get honey is to find a wild bees’ nest and take the honey from it. Often, these nests are high up in trees, and it is difficult to find them. In parts of Africa, though, people looking for honey have a strange and unexpected helper—a little bird called a honeyguide.

The honeyguide does not actually like honey, but it does like the wax in the beehives. The little bird cannot reach this wax, which is deep inside the bees’ nest. So, when it finds a suitable nest, it looks for someone to help it. The honeyguide gives a loud cry that attracts the attention of both passing animals and people. Once it has their attention, it flies through the forest, waiting from time to time for the curious animal or person as it leads them to the nest. When they finally arrive at the nest, the follower reaches in to get at the delicious honey as the bird patiently waits and watches. Some of the honey, and the wax, always falls to the ground, and this is when the honeyguide takes its share.
